# thirty_days_of_vanilla_js

This is a collection of 30 projects, inspired and created from Wes Bos'
"30 Days of Vanilla JavaScript" Tutorials, which are a great way to
brush up on your JavaScript fundamentals (without having to use any
JavaScript frameworks)!

# Day 1 - Kayle's "Cheeseburger in Caseville" Drum Kit

This project pairs audio clips (drum sounds) with specific 'keyCodes'
(keyboard codes) inputs to demonstrate how to add JavaScript's "event
listeners" to specific keyboard "events". In this case, the events are
'keydown' occurrences or specific keyboard inputs from the user. When
these event listeners notice a specific event occurring, they trigger
a function that plays a specific drum sound that we've defined ahead of
time. Check it out at https://kayledrumkit.netlify.com !
